# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native: the component fails to render data fetched from an API, even when the data is successfully retrieved.

## Bug Description
The `MyComponent` fetches data from a sample API endpoint. The fetched data is correctly parsed and available in the component's state, however, the `FlatList` remains empty.  Console logging confirms data retrieval, but the UI remains blank.

## Solution
The solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `FlatList` component is re-rendered after the data is loaded.  This is a common problem when dealing with asynchronous operations in React.
